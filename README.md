# React GitHub Deployment App (TypeScript)
This project is a simple React application built in TypeScript for the purpose of learning and implementing GitHub deployment workflows. The app demonstrates best practices in deploying to GitHub Pages, managing repository variables, handling routing, and dynamically installing npm dependencies.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Features
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:** A custom workflow for automated deployment to GitHub Pages.
- **Repository Variables:** Demonstrates the use of GitHub repository variables within the code.
- **Routing:** Implements routing to manage different pages within the app.
- **Dynamic Dependency Management:** Installs npm dependencies at deployment, including adding `react-virtualized` after initial project setup to illustrate handling new dependencies.

In the project directory, you can run:

## Commands

- Install: `npm install`
- Run: `npm start`
- Build: `npm run build`
